Laravel Notes
php framework

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable 
and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks 
used in many web projects, such as: 

Simple, fast routing engine.
Powerful dependency injection container.
Multiple back-ends for session and cache storage.
Expressive, intuitive database ORM.
Database agnostic schema migrations.
Robust background job processing.
Real-time event broadcasting.

Laravel is a MVC framework
uses OOP but isn't a single page application

MVC
Model - data
View - presentation
Controller - logic


Route middlewares are used only on specific routes.

From logic to template (methods):
- with
